# Idea for Codefundo++ 2019
This repository has idea for Microsoft Hackathon/Codefundo++ 2019 

## Basic Plan:
We are planning to build a django based web app that will be used for securing and enhancing the Election Process & Polling in India. Elections are under constant threat from criminal groups, that alter vote count and hijack polling booths. These groups also spread misinformation about the main candidates. This has a heavy influence on our Country's economy & Decision making process. To protect the virtue of democracy in our country, we would work on creating a web app that uses Microsoft AZURE's Blockchain technology and Django Framework (Python based).

## Working Explained:
###Idea 1


**Problem:** Prior to the election process, hackers breach into the voter database and alter the records. So, during the     elections voters can't ID themselves and cast a poll. Hackers then use this altered ID to cast false votes.

**Solution:** Our app will help voters to upload their ID info to the azure blockchain. All of the data will be encrypted & stored in multiple systems (Thanks to BlockChain tech.) & this will make it impossible to alter voter records.
